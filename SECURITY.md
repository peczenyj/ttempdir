# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will always apply vulnerability fixes on branch `main` and include them
in the next release. Depending on the severity, we will consider hotfixing
the most recent release too. Older releases will not be hotfixed.

| Version                   | Supported          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| branch `main`             | :white_check_mark: |
| [latest release][release] | :question:         |
| older releases            | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability privately please email [security][security]

We will try to confirm or decline your report ASAP by email. For accepted
vulnerability reports we will create an [advisory][advisory]
and, if you wish, invite you to the discussion.
